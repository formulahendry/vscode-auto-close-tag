## Note

From VS Code 1.16, it has [built-in close tag support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_16#_html-close-tags) for HTML, Handlebars and Razor files. This extension is enabled for other languages like XML, PHP, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX and so on. It is configurable.

## Features

* Automatically add closing tag when you type in the closing bracket of the opening tag
* After closing tag is inserted, the cursor is between the opening and closing tag
* Set the tag list that would not be auto closed
* Automatically close self-closing tag
* Support auto close tag as Sublime Text 3
* Use Keyboard Shortcut or Command Palette to add close tag manually

## Usages

After typing in the closing bracket of the opening tag, the closing tag will be inserted automatically.

![Usage](images/usage.gif)

To add close tag manually, use shortcut `Alt+.` (`Command+Alt+.` for Mac), or press `F1` and then select/type `Close Tag`

## Sublime Text 3 Mode

To automatically add close tag when `</` is typed (same as Sublime Text 3 does), set the below config as `true`:
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.SublimeText3Mode": true
}
```
The setting is `false` by default.

## Configuration

Use `auto-close-tag.enableAutoCloseTag` to set whether to insert close tag automatically (it is `true` by default):
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.enableAutoCloseTag": true
}
```

To set whether to close self-closing tag automatically (e.g. type `<br`, then type `/`, `>` will be added automatically) (it is `true` by default):
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.enableAutoCloseSelfClosingTag": true
}
```

Add entry into `auto-close-tag.activationOnLanguage` to set the languages that the extension will be activated. Use `["*"]` to activate for all languages. Below are the default settings:
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.activationOnLanguage": [
        "xml",
        "php",
        "blade",
        "ejs",
        "jinja",
        "javascript",
        "javascriptreact",
        "typescript",
        "typescriptreact",
        "plaintext",
        "markdown",
        "vue",
        "liquid",
        "erb",
        "lang-cfml",
        "cfml",
        "HTML (Eex)"
    ]
}
```
**Note:** The setting should be set with language id defined in [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions). Taking [javascript definition](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/javascript/package.json) as an example, we need to use `javascript` for `.js` and `.es6`, use `javascriptreact` for `.jsx`. So, if you want to enable this extension on `.js` file, you need to add `javascript` in settings.json.

Alternatively you could also exlude the languages where you don't want the extension to be activated. Below is an example:
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.disableOnLanguage": [
        "php",
        "python"
    ]
}
```

You could also set the tag list that would not be auto closed. Below are the default settings for void elements in HTML per [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/syntax.html#syntax-elements), and you could overwrite it:
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.excludedTags": [
        "area",
        "base",
        "br",
        "col",
        "command",
        "embed",
        "hr",
        "img",
        "input",
        "keygen",
        "link",
        "meta",
        "param",
        "source",
        "track",
        "wbr"
    ]
}
```

`auto-close-tag.fullMode`: Whether to enable both Visual Studio and Sublime Text mode. (Default is **false**)
